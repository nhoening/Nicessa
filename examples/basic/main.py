"""
Example nicessa simulation runner,
showing very basic usage by conducting random walks

The only thing actually needed is a __main__ block (see bottom), so that this
script is callable from the command line.
The rest of this file shows how onfiguration files can be used and log files
be written. Pointers to both are supplied by Nicessa.

Note that because Nicessa calls this script in a system call
(like you would from a command line), this example could also be a Java file*.
The point is, your simulation doesn't have to be written in Python.
All it should do is read a config file and write to a log file.

* which you would need to precompile, of course
