This is an example of Nicessa, showing subexeriment and advanced plotting.

Usage:
Go to the trunk directory in your command line. Run
>>> python exeriment.py examples/subexp

If all went well, there should now be a "plots" directory with PDFs plotting result graphs.
There is also a "data" directory with all the generated log files.

More info is in the files main.py and exeriment.conf
