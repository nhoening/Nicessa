This is an example of Nicessa, showing sub-simulations and advanced plotting.

Usage:
Go to the trunk directory in your command line. In this directory, run
>>> python <your/path/to/nicessa.py> .

If all went well, there should now be a "plots" directory with PDFs plotting result graphs.
There is also a "data" directory with all the generated log files.

More info is in the files main.py and nicessa.conf
