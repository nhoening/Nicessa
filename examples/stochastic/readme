This is the stochastic example of StoSim.

Usage:
Go to the main stosim directoy on your command line. Run
$ stosim --folder examples/stochastic

Or simply run "stosim" in this directory.

If all went well, there should now be a "plots" directory with a PDF plotting a result graph.
There is also a "data" directory with all the generated log files.

More info is in the files main.py and stosim.conf
