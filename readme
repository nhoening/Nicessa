What is this?
--------------------
Nicessa is an experiment runner.
You write the actual experiment, but nicessa relieves you of:
- arranging runs for all combinations of your dependent variables
- distributing workload on different machines
- generating nice paper-ready plots and T-Tests from the results

There are example experiment in the "example" folder.


Dependencies
--------------------
You need Python (I mostly test on 2.6 but lower versions, say 2.3+, should also work)
You need the python-paramiko library for remote server support.
For plotting, you need gnuplot and epstopdf (some tips: for debian-linux, epstopdf 
is currently in the "texlive-extra-utils" package. On OSX, install gwTex via i-installer).
For T-Tests, you need Gnu R installed.



Running a simulation
--------------------
Place an experiment configuration and your simulation code in a folder of your choice (see basic example).
Call ./experiment.py <path-to-your-experiment-folder>
The results will be put in the "data" directory, in your folder 
(but if you like the plotting capabilities of nicessa you might never look there).

There is more documentation in the "doc" directory that should have come with Nicessa.

Enjoy.
