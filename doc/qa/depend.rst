Dependencies
============

  * Nicessa is unix-only (for now at least, contact Nic if you want to help).
  * You need Python (Python 2.7 is needed on your machine, if you let Nicessa distribute work to remote machines, it is fine for the remote machines to have lower versions)
  * For plotting, you need gnuplot and epstopdf (maybe a useful tip for some: On Debian-Linux, epstopdf is currently in the "texlive-extra-utils" package. On OSX, install gwTex via i-installer)
  * You need the python-paramiko library for remote server support. It's easy install it via easy_install, which is itself also easy to get. Or simply download the source and put it in your nicessa directory, so it can be imported.
  * You need Gnu R installed for T-tests.
