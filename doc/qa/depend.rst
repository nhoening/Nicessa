Dependencies
============

  * Nicessa is unix-only (for now at least, contact Nic if you want to help).
  * You need Python (I mostly test on 2.6 but lower versions, say 2.3+, should also work)
  * For plotting, you need gnuplot and epstopdf (maybe a useful tip for some: On Debian-Linux, epstopdf is currently in the "texlive-extra-utils" package. On OSX, install gwTex via i-installer)
  * You need the python-paramiko library for remote server support (it's easy to
    get via easy_install, which is itself also easy to get).
  * You need Gnu R installed for T-tests.
