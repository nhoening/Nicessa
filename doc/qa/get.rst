How to get and install Nicessa
===============================

I develop nicessa in a `git <http://git-scm.com>`_ repository and do not make stable versions available (this will come soon). 
You get the latest version by typing ``git clone git@github.com:nhoening/Nicessa.git`` (git should be installed on
most unix systems these days, otherwise you have to install that first). This downloads the code and you can always update it by
going in that new "Nicessa"-directory this created and typing ``git pull``.

I also made a shortcut to the main executable of nicessa in my `~/.bashrc` file (`~/.profile` on Mac): 
    
    ``alias nicessa='python </your/system/path/to/>/nicessa/trunk/nicessa.py'``

so that on any command line, I can just type ``nicessa`` to start it.
