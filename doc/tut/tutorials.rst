Tutorials
==========

I made three small tutorials in which I try to cover all functionality of
Nicessa:

Basic
------
In :ref:`basic_example`, we see how to tell Nicessa about your simulation and
generate a nice plot. This tutorial is documented with the most care to get you
started.

Sub-simulations
-----------------

In :ref:`sub_example`, we use sub-simulations and plot different parts of
the data set against each other

Stochastic
-----------
In :ref:`stochastic_example`, we revisit the basic example, only now we look
at all the features Nicessa offers for stochastic simulations.

Remote
-------
In :ref:`remote_example`, we showcase how easy it is to run your simulation
distributed over remote computers.
